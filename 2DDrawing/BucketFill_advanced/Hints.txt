The final output of all demo functions is always Canvas !

Unused or not needed functions, you can simple remove from the modules

Looking the animation demo files

On this way you can output all things same hardware sprites, also on canvas !
And you have a FlipBuffers function for flicker free and absolutely easy output on canvas
This way realize automaticaly also alpha blending
You can simple write in a foreground buffer and a background buffer
Also you can read and written additional the output directly
All what you written in the background buffer, BF add to the output
All you written in the foreground buffer (hidden_Buffer) BF make a output same a sprite

Hardware sprites are ghosts, you can not simple print or save the output
BF create shapes (Brushes), you can simple saving or printing the complete output

The FipBuffers_BF function works for your eyes similar the PB FlipBuffers function
But internal absolutely other

The FlipBuffers_BF function you must set at the beginning of the loop
This function is a mighty feature, more flexible as a hardware buffer switch
You have ever 100% controll, all over, you can read and write the buffer of your choice

Sprite sheets :
You can use any sprite sheets with BF, also optimized sprite sheets with asymmetic arrangements
For a optimized sprite sheet define the complete sheet as one frame
Then you can simple select a sprite inside the sheet with the Sprite_CSS_sheet... clip functions
At the same way BF make the GIF output, you can see this in the GIF output demo codes
A sample
You can deactivate the invisible color for a sprite sheet or GIF output
Make the output to a temporary image
Rotate this temporary image with the special BF sprite rotating function
Then you can output sprite sheets or GIF also with rotation
